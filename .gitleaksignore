# Gitleaks ignore file
# 
# Use this file to ignore false positives from Gitleaks secret detection.
# Each line should contain a specific string that Gitleaks detected but is not actually a secret.
#
# Format: Paste the exact secret string that was detected (without quotes)
# You can find these in the Gitleaks output or test-reports/gitleaks.json
#
# Examples:
# - Documentation placeholder keys: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
# - Example keys in code samples: example-key-12345
# - Test/demo credentials that are intentionally shown
#
# Note: Be very careful when adding entries here. Only add strings that you're
# absolutely certain are not real secrets!

# Example placeholders commonly used in documentation
# (Add specific entries as needed when false positives are discovered)
