# Mapping Out The Merge

**Date:** 22-08-30

The Merge—Ethereum’s long-awaited transition to Proof-of-Stake—is fast approaching. The timeline has some uncertainty, but the best estimates suggest we are a little over two weeks out with a tentative date for The Merge of September 15th. Ethereum developers are determined to complete one of the most significant and intricate changes in crypto’s history without disrupting a network that secures and settles billions of dollars worth of value on-chain daily.

At Coin Metrics, many teams are working hard in preparation for The Merge. As part of our support for Ethereum’s major network upgrade, we are excited to be releasing a new data-driven research report explaining the essential features of The Merge and its implications for the future of Ethereum’s security, economics, and more. You can download our report, Mapping Out The Merge, for free below.

As of August 29, the week-over-week active address count decreased among Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other assets. After HUSD’s recent de-pegging, Binance USD (BUSD) and Paxos Standard (USDP), two other stablecoins, increased in market cap by 4% and 9%, respectively—perhaps capturing more outstanding market share after HUSD’s dislocations.
