Exchanges and Trading

Stablecoins and DeFi

Bitcoin became intertwined with traditional markets this year due to changing macro conditions and a big increase in institutional interest. We covered Bitcoin’s journey over the course of 2020, from the March crypto crash to Q4’s institutional endorsements. Last week, we released our 2020 Year In Review summarizing crypto’s year quarter by quarter:

In Issue 80 we released an in-depth research report about using on-chain data to gauge bitcoin market cycles: The Bitcoin On-chain Indicators Primer. We also introduced several new metrics throughout the year, including free float supply:
