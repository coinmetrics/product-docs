# SOTN at Three

**Date:** 22-06-01

State of the Network just turned three years old! Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto ecosystem has grown a lot since our first issue.

In a special edition to celebrate 3 years of State of the Network we’ve put together a collection of crypto data insights highlighting just how much things have changed since we released our first issue on May 29th, 2019. These insights include a mix of on-chain data and crypto market data, all sourced from our in-house data products.

But first, we’re incredibly grateful for the more than 18,000 State of the Network readers today, some of whom have kindly shared their thoughts on SOTN with us.

Spencer Noon, Co-Founder of Variant and Creator of OurNetwork

“Congrats to SOTN on the 3-year anniversary! I’ve been a regular reader since the early days and have always appreciated your intense commitment to going as deep into the on-chain data as necessary in order to arrive at its fundamental truths. As a crypto community we are very lucky to have this caliber of research published for free and I would encourage anyone who calls themselves a data-driven investor to subscribe.”

TakensTheorem, Data Visualization Artist & Independent Crypto Researcher

“SOTN synchronizes you to the market with crisp and clear graphs and numerics. Something I've noticed over the years: SOTN articles can also have amazing staying power. I find myself going back regularly to previously published articles for reminders of various market details, like stablecoin design features, history of crypto adoption or usage, and research that scores a blockchain's auditability (#30 from 2019 is epic!).”

Alex Mead, Technical Research Analyst at Coin Metrics

“I first discovered Coin Metrics’ State of the Network after hearing Nic Carter on the What Bitcoin Did podcast, episode 476. Nic shared many interesting thoughts about the US Dollar and its presence on the global stage. Digging deeper I found Coin Metrics and began to read back issues of the State of the Network. The publication captured my imagination to such a degree that I decided to apply for an open position on the Coin Metrics team. I have since joined Coin Metrics and continue to read the State of the Network weekly.”

David Hollerith, Reporter, Yahoo Finance

“State of the Network is a reasonable mix of market summary and data, no frills or promotions. A great way to get a quick pulse check on one of the fastest markets around.”

As the data below shows, the digital assets industry is ever-changing, and we look forward to continuing to highlight the most interesting data and trends in this emerging space.
