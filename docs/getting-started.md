# Getting Started

Welcome! Follow the steps below to get started with using Coin Metrics data.

## 1. Set up Your API Key

Most of our data requires an API Key. If you want an API key, get in touch with us on our contact page: [https://coinmetrics.io/contact/](https://coinmetrics.io/contact/)

We offer some data for free under our Community Data. For more information, go to: [coin-metrics-community-data.md](packages/coin-metrics-community-data.md "mention")

Data coverage can be seen by plugging in your API key at [coverage.coinmetrics.io](https://coverage.coinmetrics.io)

## 2. Learn How to Use Coin Metrics Tools

Coin Metrics offers several ways to access our data.

### For Business Users

You can use our [Data Viz](https://charts.coinmetrics.io/crypto-data/) to create charts dynamically using a point-and-click interface without any code. To learn how to use the charting tool, see our data visualization guide.

You can directly download files from your browser by adding a "format=csv" in your HTTP request, i.e. `https://api.coinmetrics.io/v4/timeseries/asset-metrics?assets=btc&metrics=PriceUSD,FlowInGEMUSD&frequency=1d&pretty=true&api_key=<your_key>&format=csv`

On Google Sheets, you can use the `IMPORTDATA` function on the formula tab:

`=IMPORTDATA("`[`https://api.coinmetrics.io/v4/timeseries/asset-metrics?metrics=CapMrktEstUSD,SplyCur,PriceUSD,CapMrktCurUSD&api_key=`](https://api.coinmetrics.io/v4/timeseries/asset-metrics?metrics=CapMrktEstUSD,SplyCur,PriceUSD,CapMrktCurUSD\&api\_key=)`<API_KEY>&assets=usdc&frequency=1d&limit_per_asset=1&format=csv")`

For more information on exporting data, see the guide: [exporting-data.md](tutorials-and-examples/user-guides/exporting-data.md "mention")
