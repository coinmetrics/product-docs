Data coverage can be seen by plugging in your API key at [coverage.coinmetrics.io](https://coverage.coinmetrics.io)

## Learn How to Use Coin Metrics Tools

Coin Metrics offers several ways to access our data.

### For Business Users

You can use our [Data Viz](https://charts.coinmetrics.io/crypto-data/) to create charts dynamically using a point-and-click interface without any code. To learn how to use the charting tool, see our data visualization guide.
