### Instructions

The notebook linked above shows how to obtain liquidation metrics for futures. We show both REST API calls and web socket connections for the same.&#x20;

The video also covers how to use Reference Data and Catalog. It is applicable for all market data / asset metrics.

The notebook was published for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you want to use it in Colab, the easiest way is to open Colab and load the notebook from the Github URL (pasted into the open dialog). This method does not require cloning the repo first.

If you prefer to use the notebook with Jupyter, all you need to change is the way in which the API key is retrieved.&#x20;
