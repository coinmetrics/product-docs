### Instructions

The notebook linked above shows how to obtain predicted funding rates for futures. While the _actual_ funding rates don't change very frequently, the _predicted_ funding rate is calculated every minute or so and therefore can be a leading indicator for funding rate changes.&#x20;

This video also compares two plotting libraries: matplotlib and plotly express.

The notebook was published for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you want to use it in Colab, the easiest way is to open Colab and load the notebook from the Github URL (pasted into the open dialog). This method does not require cloning the repo first.

If you prefer to use the notebook with Jupyter, all you need to change is the way in which the API key is retrieved.&#x20;
