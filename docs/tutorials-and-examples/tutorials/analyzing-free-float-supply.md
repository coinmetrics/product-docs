### Instructions

The notebook linked above shows how to obtain the asset metric "Free Float Supply" for a variety of crypto assets, and how to draw some conclusions by comparing the metric indexed to a particular date.&#x20;

The video also covers how to use Reference Data and Catalog. It is applicable for all network data / asset metrics.

The notebook was published for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you want to use it in Colab, the easiest way is to open Colab and load the notebook from the Github URL (pasted into the open dialog). This method does not require cloning the repo first.

If you prefer to use the notebook with Jupyter, all you need to change is the way in which the API key is retrieved. The video actually does not use an API key, since we demo the community API. If you have an API key, you should use it since it will speed up the downloads significantly.
