## Xfer'd Val, Adj <a href="#txtfrvaladj" id="txtfrvaladj"></a>

### Definition

The sum of native units or USD transferred that interval removing noise and certain artifacts. Also known as Adjusted Transfer Value.

| Name                           | MetricID       | Unit         | Interval |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Xfer'd Val, Adj (native units) | TxTfrValAdjNtv | Native units | 1 day    |
| Xfer'd Val, Adj (USD)          | TxTfrValAdjUSD | USD          | 1 day    |

### Details

* For UTXO chains, the heuristics used are:
  * Early spend: outputs spent one hour or less after being created are not counted
  * Round numbers: if one output has much more precision than the other outputs in the same transaction, it’s not counted. For example, if a transaction creates 2 outputs, one of 1.00000000 BTC and one of 0.2561278 BTC, the second one would not be counted.
  * Self churn: outputs that have the same address as any of the inputs addresses are discounted
  * Also removed are cold wallet shuffles (when an exchange changes their cold wallet addresses) and other artifacts such as noise generated by early Bitcoin applications like Satoshi Dice
* For account chains, this metric is computed as the sum number of native units received by accounts, whose net balance did change in that hour.

### Asset-Specific Details

* For assets that have opt-in privacy features, like ZCash, it only takes the non-private activity.

### Example

* If in the same hour:
  * \*\* Account A sends 50 units to B
  * \*\* Account C sends 50 units to A
  * \*\* Account B sends 50 units to E
  * \*\* Account D sends 49 units to B
* Then:
  * \*\* Account A has a net balance change of 0, received 50
  * \*\* Account B has a net balance change of -1, received 99
  * \*\* Account C has a net balance change of -50, received 0
  * \*\* Account D has a net balance change of -49, received 0
  * \*\* Account E has a net balance change of +50, received 50
* \*\*\* Unadjusted volume is 199
* \*\*\* Adjusted volume is 149 (B: 99, E: 50)

## Xfer'd by Contract Calls <a href="#txtfrvalcontcallmtv" id="txtfrvalcontcallmtv"></a>

### Definition

The sum of all native units or USD transferred by contract calls on that interval. A contract call is the invocation of a contract’s code by another contract or non-contract address. Only successful calls are considered.

| Name                                    | MetricID            | Unit         | Interval |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Xfer'd by Contract Calls (native units) | TxTfrValContCallNtv | Native units | 1 day    |
| Xfer'd by Contract Calls (USD)          | TxTfrValContCallUSD | Native units | 1 day    |

### Details

* `TxTrfValContCallNtv` is computed as TxTfrValAdjNtv / BlkSizeByte
* `TxTrfValContCallUSD` is computed as TxTfrValAdjUSD / BlkSizeByte
* This metric estimates the economical density of an asset.

### Release History

* Released in the 4.2 release of NDP

## Xfer'd Days Destroyed <a href="#txtfrvaldaydst" id="txtfrvaldaydst"></a>

### Definitions

The sum of all native units transferred that interval multiplied by the sum of days since those native units were last transferred.

| Name                  | MetricID       | Unit          | Interval       |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Xfer'd Days Destroyed | TxTfrValDayDst | Dimensionless | 1 day, 1 block |

### Details

* Days destroyed is a measure of time \* money.
* When an unspent output is spent, the time it stayed unspent (in days) is multiplied by its value, this metric measures the sum of these coin days spent in a given day.
* Only full days are taken into account (2.5 days count as 2 days)

### Asset-Specific Details

* Only available for UTXO chains.
* For assets that have opt-in privacy features, like ZCash, it only takes the non-private activity.

### Release History

* Released in the 1.0 release of NDP

## Mean Xfer'd Days Destroyed <a href="#txtfrvaldaydstmean" id="txtfrvaldaydstmean"></a>

### Definition

The mean per transaction of the sum of all native units transferred multiplied by the sum of days since those native units were last transferred that interval.

| Name                       | MetricID           | Unit          | Interval |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | -------- |
| Mean Xfer'd Days Destroyed | TxTfrValDayDstMean | Dimensionless | 1 day    |

### Details

* Computed as TxTfrValDayDst / TxCnt

* Only available for UTXO chains
* For assets that have opt-in privacy features, like ZCash, it only takes the non-private activity.

### Release History

## Mean Tx Size <a href="#txtfrvalmean" id="txtfrvalmean"></a>

### Definition

The sum value of native units or USD transferred divided by the count of transfers (i.e., the mean size of a transfer) between distinct addresses that interval.

| Name                        | MetricID        | Category     | Subcategory    | Type | Unit         | Interval      |

| Mean Tx Size (USD)          | TxTfrValMeanUSD | Transactions | Transfer value | Mean | USD          | 1 day, 1 hour |

### Details

* TxTfrValMeanNtv is computed as TxTfrValNtv / TxTfrCnt
