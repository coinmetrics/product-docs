## Details

* Native units are considered as sent to an exchange if they are sent to an address we identify as being owned by an exchange.
* Native units are considered as withdrawn if they leave the control of an address we identify as being owned by an exchange.
* This metric is the net of the sends and withdrawals that interval.
* USD metrics are computed as FlowNet{Exchange}Ntv \* PriceUSD

## Asset-Specific Details

* This metric might not be available for all assets. Either that exchange doesnâ€™t support this asset (BitMEX only trades in BTC for example), or we deemed that our coverage of the exchange was not complete enough to release the metric for it.
* For Bitcoin, this metric excludes the effect of change outputs:
*
  * If a transaction sends 90 BTC to exchange A but also withdraws 50 BTC from it, the flow is +40 BTC, not +90 BTC and -50 BTC.

## Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP
