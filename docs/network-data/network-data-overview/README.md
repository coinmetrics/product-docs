# Network Data Pro Overview

Network Data Pro (NDP) provides insightful, aggregate network data metrics for a wide-variety of cryptoasset networks. We run blockchain nodes to collect and harmonize information from dozens of blockchains.

Our Network Data Pro metrics are aggregated at the asset level.
