* USD flows are computed as FlowIn{Exchange}Ntv \* PriceUSD

### Asset-Specific Details

* This metric might not be available for all assets. Either the exchange doesnâ€™t support this asset, or we deemed that our coverage of the exchange was not complete enough to release the metric for it.
* For Bitcoin, this metric excludes the effect of change outputs:
  * If a transaction sends 90 BTC to exchange A but also withdraws 50 BTC from it, the flow is +40 BTC, not +90 BTC and -50 BTC.

### Examples

* During times of market stress or uncertainty, we see an uptick in BTC/funds being moved to exchanges. During the Luna collapse in spring 2021, we can see a rise in BTC being sent to both Bitfinex and Binance which is a precursor for more downside pressure as often times users are converting their funds into fiat or stable coins.

### Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP

### Interpretation

* This metric looks at the flow of funds being sent to Bitfinex and can give us a sense of market sentiment.

### Details

* Coinbase (i.e., miner reward) transactions are not counted.

### Asset-Specific Details

* For UTXO-based protocols, this metric does not count change outputs:
*
  * If the input addresses belong to Bitfinex, then the outputs belonging to Bitfinex are not counted as transfers to Bitfinex
* For account-based protocols, if both sender and recipient belong to Bitfinex, then the transfer is not counted.

### Release History

* Version 4.2 of CM Network Data Pro Daily Macro (End of Day)
