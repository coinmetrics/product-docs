### Details

* Native units are considered as withdrawn if they leave the control of an address we identify as being owned by an exchange.

### Asset-Specific Details

* This metric might not be available for all assets. Either that exchange doesn’t support this asset (BitMEX only trades in BTC for example), or we deemed that our coverage of the exchange was not complete enough to release the metric for it.
* For Bitcoin, this metric excludes the effect of change outputs:
*
  * If a transaction spends 100 BTC from exchange A but 90 BTC are sent back to it as change, the flow is -10 BTC, not -100 BTC and +90 BTC.

### Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP

## Exchange Withdrawals (Total) <a href="#flowoutex" id="flowoutex"></a>

### Definition

The sum withdrawn from exchanges that day, excluding exchange to exchange activity.

| Name                                | MetricID     | Unit         | Interval       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Exchange Withdrawals (native units) | FlowOutExNtv | Native units | 1 block, 1 day |
| Exchange Withdrawals (USD)          | FlowOutExUSD | USD          | 1 block, 1 day |

### Details

* This metric captures interactions between users of a cryptoasset and exchanges supporting that market. It excludes inter-exchange activity.
* If a transaction sends 90 units from exchange B to exchange A, it doesn’t count towards this metric.
* If a transaction spends 10 units from exchange A and sends 5 units to exchange B and 5 units to unknown destination, it counts as a 5 units outflow for exchanges overall, 10 units outflow for exchange A, 5 units inflow for exchange B

### Release History

* Released in the 4.0 release of NDP

### Details

* Coinbase (i.e., miner reward) transactions are not counted.

### Asset-Specific Details

* For account-based protocols, if both sender and recipient belong to Bitfinex, then the transfer is not counted.
* For UTXO-based protocols, this metric applies the following logic:
  * If the input addresses belong to Bitfinex, then only the outputs where the address doesn’t belong to Bitfinex are counted as transfers from Bitfinex.

### Release History

* Version 4.2 of CM Network Data Pro Daily Macro (End of Day)
