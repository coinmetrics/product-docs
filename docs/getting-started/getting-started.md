# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with using Coin Metrics data. It is divided into three sections:

* [Tutorials](tutorials/tutorials.md)
* [Explainers](../network-data/deprecated/)
* [How-To Guides](how-to-guides/how-to-guides.md)

**Tutorials** are walkthroughs for exploring Coin Metrics data. The goal is for a user to achieve a basic familiarity with using Coin Metrics data and learn what is possible.

**How-To Guides** are instructions for accomplishing specific tasks. These tasks may include "_how to export data into a CSV_" or "_how to make a chart using the charting tool_" or "_how to make the Python API Client run faster_". How-to guides assume a basic familiarity with Coin Metrics data and tools such as the API.

**Explainers** are conceptual guides that decode _why_ Coin Metrics tools and datasets are structured the way there are. The goal for explainers is to help the user understand our data.
