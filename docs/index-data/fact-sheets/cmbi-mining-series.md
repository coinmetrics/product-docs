# CMBI Mining Series

The CMBI Mining Series provide the cryptoasset community, investors and asset managers with publicly available and investable benchmarks that reliably and accurately track the activity of one of cryptoâ€™s critical functions, mining. The CMBI Bitcoin Hash Rate (CMBIHASH) represents the implied hash rate that miners are contributing to Bitcoin at any single point in time. The CMBI Bitcoin Hash Rate utilize a 48hr lookback window to accurately reflect the current performance of miners whilst maintaining resistance to outlier results and potentially manipulative activities. The CMBI Bitcoin Observed Work (CMBIWORK) utilizes the real-time levels from the CMBI Bitcoin Hash Rate to represent an approximation for the number of hashes that have been conducted over the previous 24hr period.
