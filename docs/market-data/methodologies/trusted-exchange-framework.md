# Trusted Exchange Framework

## Introduction

The Coin Metricsâ€™ Trusted Exchange Framework (TEF) is a quantitative evaluation of crypto exchanges. We leverage the CM Market Data Feed and our extensive experience from collecting data to create a rigorous assessment across several key categories. The TEF serves as both a guideline for exchange quality as well as an input to [Market Data Pro](https://coinmetrics.io/market-data-pro/) and [CM Prices](https://coinmetrics.io/prices/), and [Indexes](https://coinmetrics.io/cmbi/).

The documentation supporting this framework can be found via the link below.
