# Slippage

## Definition

Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade (based on the current order book) and the actual price at which the trade is executed.

## Details

Price slippage is the difference, represented as a percentage, between the quoted price of an asset and the execution price of a market order. The bid slippage metrics represent the price slippage of a market sell order. And the ask slippage metrics represent the price slippage of a market buy order. The slippage reflects how much the price of the asset moves when buying or selling into the market. For instance, if you are purchasing a quantity of $1,000 worth of the asset, the slippage metric tells you how much higher the price will be than the price you would expect if there was no slippage (i.e., based purely on the current bid-ask spread).

The metric is calculated using the following steps:

1. Identify the best bid and ask price on the order book (the lowest price at which sellers are willing to buy and sell, respectively).
2. Determine the cumulative bid or ask amount at increasing price levels above the best bid or ask. This is the total quantity of assets that are willing to be bought or available for sale at each price point.
3. Find the price at which a $X market order in U.S. dollars can be fully executed. This is done by consuming the bid or ask orders starting at the best bid or ask and moving up the order book until the $1,000 worth of liquidity is filled.
4. Calculate the slippage as the percentage difference between the effective execution price at which the order is executed and the best ask price (the price you would expect without slippage).

$$\text{Liquidity Slippage } \$X \text{ Ask Percent} = \left( \frac{\text{Executed Price} - \text{Best Ask Price}}{\text{Best Ask Price}} \right)$$

$$\text{Liquidity Slippage } \$X \text{ Bid Percent} = \left( \frac{\text{Best Bid Price} - \text{Executed Price}}{\text{Best Bid Price}} \right)$$

For example, letâ€™s say an investor wishes to purchase 1 BTC at the best ask price of $25,000 and they submit a market order. The top of the order book has a sell order at this price for 0.25 BTC, so .25 BTC is purchased at $25,000 per BTC. The next order in the orderbook is for 0.5 BTC, but at a price of $25,250. This is executed and 0.5 BTC is purchased at $25,250 per BTC. 0.75 BTC has now been purchased, and 0.25 BTC remain. The investor completes his order at the next offer in the orderbook, 0.5 BTC for $25,500. As only 0.25 BTC are needed to complete the 1 BTC purchase, the investor fills 0.25 BTC at the price of $25,500 per BTC. The effective execution price of this purchase is the average price of the individual orders, weighted by quantity:

### $$\frac{0.25\times\$25,000 + 0.5\times\$25,250 + 0.25\times\$25,500}{0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25} = \$25,250$$

The slippage is the percentage difference in the market price and this execution price:

$$\frac{\$25,250-\$25,000}{\$25,000} = 1\%$$

So this hypothetical purchase of 1 BTC incurred 1% slippage. If the trade size was different, then the slippage would change; that is, slippage is dependent on order size.
