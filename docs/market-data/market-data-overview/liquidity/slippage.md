## Details

Price slippage is the difference, represented as a percentage, between the quoted price of an asset and the execution price of a market order. The bid slippage metrics represent the price slippage of a market sell order. And the ask slippage metrics represent the price slippage of a market buy order. The slippage reflects how much the price of the asset moves when buying or selling into the market. For instance, if you are purchasing a quantity of $1,000 worth of the asset, the slippage metric tells you how much higher the price will be than the price you would expect if there was no slippage (i.e., based purely on the current bid-ask spread).

The metric is calculated using the following steps:

Convert the market order in U.S. dollars to units of the base asset for spot markets and units of the contract:

* $$\text{Market Order Size (units)} = \frac{\text{Market Order Size (USD)}}{\text{Price of Base Asset (USD)}}$$
* $$\text{Market Order Size (contract units)} = \frac{\text{Market Order Size (USD)}}{\text{Contract Size} \times \text{Contract Size Asset (USD)}}$$

Determine the cumulative bid or ask amount at increasing price levels including and above the best bid or ask. This is the total quantity of assets that are willing to be bought or available for sale at each price point:

* $$L(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_i$$

Find the price at which a $X market order in U.S. dollars can be fully executed. This is done by consuming the bid or ask orders starting at the best bid or ask and moving up the order book until $X worth of orders are filled. In other words, find the smallest $$n$$ such that:

* $$L(n) \geq \text {Market Order Size}$$

Calculate the effective execution price as the volume-weighted average price of the orders that are required to fully execute the market order, taking into account that the last limit order that the market order matches with may only be partially executed:

* $$P_{\text{exec}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \min\left(Q_i, X - L(i-1) \right)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \min\left(Q_i, X - L(i-1) \right)}$$

Calculate the slippage as the percentage difference between the effective execution price at which the order is executed and the midprice (the price you would expect without slippage):

* $$\text{Liquidity Slippage } \$X \text{ Percent} = \left( \frac{\left| P_{\text{exec}} - P_{\text{midprice}} \right|}{P_{\text{midprice}}} \right) \times 100$$

For example, let’s say an investor wishes to purchase 1 BTC at the best ask price of $25,000 and they submit a market order. The top of the order book has a sell order at this price for 0.25 BTC, so .25 BTC is purchased at $25,000 per BTC. The next order in the orderbook is for 0.5 BTC, but at a price of $25,250. This is executed and 0.5 BTC is purchased at $25,250 per BTC. 0.75 BTC has now been purchased, and 0.25 BTC remain. The investor completes his order at the next offer in the orderbook, 0.5 BTC for $25,500. As only 0.25 BTC are needed to complete the 1 BTC purchase, the investor fills 0.25 BTC at the price of $25,500 per BTC. The effective execution price of this purchase is the average price of the individual orders, weighted by quantity:

* $$\frac{0.25\times\$25,000 + 0.5\times\$25,250 + 0.25\times\$25,500}{0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25} = \$25,250$$

The slippage is the percentage difference in the market price and this execution price:

* $$\frac{\$25,250-\$25,000}{\$25,000} = 1\%$$

So this hypothetical purchase of 1 BTC incurred 1% slippage. If the trade size was different, then the slippage would change; that is, slippage is dependent on order size.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Why are some of the values for some slippage metrics and observations missing?**

Coin Metrics calculates slippage metrics from order book snapshots obtained from centralized exchanges. Coin Metrics will obtain the deepest and most complete order book snapshot that the exchange offers — however, the order book depth allowed varies by exchange.

If the order book depth for a market is insufficient to calculate a particular slippage depth metric for a $X market order, Coin Metrics will assign a null value to the observation. The null value was chosen instead of using the available depth to calculate a value (even if the order book depth is insufficient to calculate a value for a given order size) to provide transparecy to the user that the order book depth is too shallow. If a non-null value is desired, it is recommended to select a metric with a smaller $X order size.

For more information on the available order book depth by exchange, please see [**Are there any limitations to the order book depth provided by each exchange?**](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/market-data/market-data-overview/market-order-book#are-there-any-limitations-to-the-order-book-depth-provided-by-each-exchange) Please note that some exchanges only provide an order book with very shallow depth, such as the top 100 levels. Therefore, a large number of nulls can be expected from markets from these exchanges.

### How often are the metrics calculated?

The depth metrics are calculated once an hour.
