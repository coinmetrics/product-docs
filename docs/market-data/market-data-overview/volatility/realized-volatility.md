# Realized Volatility

## Overview

The rolling realized volatility, measured as the standard deviation of the natural log of returns prices in U.S. dollars calculated every 10 minutes over the specified interval.

## Data Sources and Methodology

Coin Metrics calculates realized volatility using our [Real-Time Reference Rates](../../methodologies/coin-metrics-prices-methodology.md#reference-rates-calculation-methodology) as the price input. Volatility is calculated using the close-to-close method, as this is optimal for continuous markets and is widely accepted across financial literature. For this calculation we use the population mean with zero drift, meaning the formula reduces to:

$$
RV=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(ln(\frac{s_i}{s_{i-1}}) - 0)^2}\cdot\sqrt{T}
$$

Where $$RV$$is the realized volatility (annualized), $$N$$is the lookback window, $${s_i}$$ is the real-time reference rate price at time $$i$$, and $$T$$ is the time adjustment factor. Using an average return of 0 is standard in these calculations as it avoids misleading volatility numbers during sustained periods of substantially high or low return.

The real-time reference rates are resampled to calculate returns over a 10 minute period, as this frequency captures the rapid nature of volatility in cryptocurrency markets. Volatility is then annualized by setting $$T=6â‹…24â‹…365$$, as crypto markets trade 24 hours a day each day of the year. Volatility can then be calculated on a rolling window with a specified lookback.
