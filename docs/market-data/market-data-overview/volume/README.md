# Volume

Coin Metrics calculates trusted volume and reported volume metrics for a variety of entities.

The trusted volume metrics sum all volume from the spot markets of a set of trusted exchanges in U.S. dollars. The trusted volume metrics are available for assets and pairs.

The reported volume metrics represent various aggregations of spot market, futures market, and option market volume in U.S. dollars. The reported volume metrics are available for assets, exchanges, exchange-assets, and pairs. These metrics are referred to as reported because the input data is reported trades from centralized and decentralized exchanges.b
